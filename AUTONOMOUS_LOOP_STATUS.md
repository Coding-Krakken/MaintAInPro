## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Enable Deployments
1. **Set up Vercel project**: `vercel --confirm`
2. **Get credentials**: Vercel token, org ID, project ID
3. **Add GitHub secrets**: Repository settings → Secrets → Actions
4. **Test deployment**: Should auto-deploy on next push

### Priority 2: Configure Branch Protection  
1. **Repository settings** → Branches → Add rule for `main`
2. **Enable auto-merge** in repository settings
3. **Test PR workflow** with a sample change

### Priority 3: Test Complete Loop
1. **Wait for agent** to pick up created issues
2. **Monitor PR creation** and auto-merge process
3. **Verify deployment** and health checks
4. **Confirm loop continuation** creates next tasks

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ **3 issues created** by autonomous planner
- ✅ **100% workflow YAML syntax** validated
- ✅ **All required labels** configured
- ✅ **Health endpoint** implemented
- ⏳ **0 successful deployments** (pending Vercel setup)
- ⏳ **0 autonomous PRs merged** (waiting for agent)

## 🔍 How to Monitor

```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Monitor created issues  
gh issue list --label autoplan

# Watch for agent PRs
gh pr list --label automerge

# View deployment status (after Vercel setup)
vercel logs
```

## 🚀 Expected Behavior (Once Configured)

1. **Every 6 hours**: Planner scans Blueprint, creates issues
2. **Agent picks up**: Issues with `agent-ok` label get implemented  
3. **PRs auto-merge**: After passing CI and having `automerge` label
4. **Auto-deployment**: Successful merges deploy to Vercel
5. **Health validation**: Failed health checks trigger rollback
6. **Traceability logging**: All actions tracked in documentation
7. **Loop continuation**: Next planning cycle triggered

**🎉 The autonomous loop infrastructure is 95% complete!**  
**Only Vercel secrets and branch protection remain to activate full automation.**
