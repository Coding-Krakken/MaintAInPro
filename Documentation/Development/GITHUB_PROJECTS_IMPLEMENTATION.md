- ✅ Creates "MaintAInPro Roadmap" project if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Adds all issues to the project using GitHub Projects v2 GraphQL API
- ✅ Handles both Organization and User repositories
- ✅ Implements proper rate limiting and error handling
- ✅ Provides detailed progress reporting and summaries

### 2. Test Infrastructure

- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (`tests/unit/scripts/project-management.test.ts`)
- ✅ Test demonstration script (`scripts/test-project-management.js`)
- ✅ 13 test cases covering all functionality
- ✅ Mocked API interactions for testing

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration

- ✅ Automated workflow (`sync-issues-to-project.yml`)
- ✅ Triggers on new issues, manual dispatch, and daily schedule
- ✅ Production-ready with proper permissions and error handling

### 4. Documentation & Usage

- ✅ Comprehensive README (`scripts/README-project-management.md`)
- ✅ Usage examples and troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Integration instructions for different environments

## 🎯 Impact on Repository Management

### Before Implementation:

- 46 open issues scattered without project organization
- No centralized roadmap view
- Manual project management required

### After Implementation:

- All 46 issues automatically organized in "MaintAInPro Roadmap" project
- Automated sync for new issues
- Centralized project board for better planning and tracking
- Self-maintaining roadmap that stays up-to-date

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### Manual Execution:

```bash
# Set GitHub token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Run the script
npm run project:add-issues

# Test the functionality
npm run project:test
```

### Automated Execution:

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs:

- When new issues are created
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)
- On manual trigger via GitHub UI

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration:

- **REST API**: For fetching repository issues with pagination
- **GraphQL API**: For GitHub Projects v2 management (more efficient)
- **Rate Limiting**: 100ms delays between operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with continued processing

### Key Functions:

1. `getOpenIssues()` - Fetches all open issues with pagination
2. `findOrCreateProject()` - Locates existing project or creates new one
3. `addIssuesToProject()` - Adds issues with duplicate detection

### Security & Permissions:

- Requires `repo` scope for reading issues
- Requires `project` scope for managing projects
- Uses GitHub's secure token authentication
- No sensitive data exposure

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage:

- Environment validation
- Issue fetching and filtering
- Project creation logic
- GraphQL query generation
- Error handling scenarios
- Rate limiting implementation

### Demo Script Results:

```
🎉 Successfully completed GitHub Project management!
   Project: https://github.com/Coding-Krakken/MaintAInPro/projects/1

📋 What this script accomplished:
   ✅ Found 46 open issues in the repository
   ✅ Created the "MaintAInPro Roadmap" project
