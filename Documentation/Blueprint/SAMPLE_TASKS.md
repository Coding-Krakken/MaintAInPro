# Sample Blueprint Tasks for Autonomous Testing

This file contains sample tasks to demonstrate the autonomous development loop.

## Task: Add Basic Health Monitoring Dashboard

Create a simple dashboard component that displays system health metrics from the `/health` endpoint.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Create a HealthDashboard component in `client/src/components/admin/HealthDashboard.tsx`
- [ ] Display current system status, uptime, and memory usage
- [ ] Show deployment information (SHA, build ID, timestamp)
- [ ] Include feature flag status indicators
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Unit tests for HealthDashboard component
- [ ] Integration test for health API endpoint consumption
- [ ] E2E test for dashboard functionality

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/admin/HealthDashboard.tsx`
- `client/src/services/healthService.ts`
- `client/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`

## Task: Implement Basic Feature Flag Toggle UI

Create an admin interface for toggling feature flags in real-time.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Create FeatureFlagToggle component in `client/src/components/admin/FeatureFlagToggle.tsx`
- [ ] Display current feature flag states
- [ ] Allow admin users to toggle flags on/off
- [ ] Show which flags require app restart vs immediate effect
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for critical feature changes
- [ ] Include audit logging for flag changes

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Unit tests for toggle component
- [ ] Integration tests for feature flag API
- [ ] Permission-based access tests
- [ ] Audit trail verification tests

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/components/admin/FeatureFlagToggle.tsx`
- `server/routes/admin/featureFlags.ts`
- `shared/types/featureFlags.ts`

## Task: Create Basic Performance Metrics Collection

Implement client-side performance monitoring to track Core Web Vitals and user interactions.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Create performance tracking utility in `client/src/lib/performance.ts`
- [ ] Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB)
- [ ] Monitor route navigation performance
- [ ] Collect API response times
- [ ] Send metrics to backend for aggregation
- [ ] Implement sampling to avoid overhead

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Unit tests for performance utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for metrics collection
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Data accuracy validation tests

**Files to modify:**
- `client/src/lib/performance.ts`
- `client/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts`
- `server/routes/api/metrics.ts`

**Note**: These tasks are designed to test the autonomous development loop. Each task follows the standard format expected by the Blueprint planner and includes comprehensive acceptance criteria and test requirements.
