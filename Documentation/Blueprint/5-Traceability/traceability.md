# MaintAInPro Traceability Framework

## Overview

The MaintAInPro Traceability Framework ensures complete audit trails, compliance, and accountability across the entire software development lifecycle. This framework integrates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), quality gates, process governance, and deployment tracking to provide comprehensive visibility into all changes, decisions, and operations.

## Purpose

This documentation provides:

- **Compliance Support**: Complete audit trails for regulatory requirements and internal governance
- **Onboarding Guide**: Clear understanding of traceability processes for new team members  
- **Decision Tracking**: How architectural and process decisions are recorded and linked
- **Quality Assurance**: Evidence-based gates and validation processes
- **Incident Response**: Rapid identification of changes, decisions, and deployments for troubleshooting

---

## Core Components

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document all significant architectural and process decisions with full context and rationale.

#### Location & Structure
- **Template**: [`artifacts/adr/ADR_TEMPLATE.md`](../../artifacts/adr/ADR_TEMPLATE.md)
- **Repository**: `artifacts/adr/` directory
- **Examples**: [`Documentation/Blueprint/adr-drizzle-orm.md`](../adr-drizzle-orm.md)

#### ADR Process
1. **Creation**: Use the ADR template for all significant decisions
2. **Review**: Decisions are reviewed and approved by stakeholders
3. **Linking**: ADRs reference related RFCs, requirements, and threat models
4. **Status Tracking**: Each ADR has a clear status (proposed, accepted, superseded, rejected)
5. **Evidence**: Include supporting evidence like performance reports, cost models, or benchmarks

#### ADR Content Requirements
- **Context**: Background, goals, and constraints
- **Options**: Alternatives considered with pros/cons
- **Decision**: Chosen option with clear justification
- **Consequences**: Implications, trade-offs, and follow-up work
- **Evidence**: Supporting data, reports, or analysis
- **Reconsideration Triggers**: Conditions that would warrant revisiting the decision

### 2. Process Graph & Workflow

The process graph defines the complete software development lifecycle with mandatory phases and decision points.

#### Graph Definition
- **Source**: [`.process/graph.yaml`](../../.process/graph.yaml)
- **Visualization**: Auto-generated Mermaid diagrams
- **Validation**: [`ci/validate_graph.py`](../../ci/validate_graph.py)

#### Workflow Phases
```mermaid

```

#### Phase Details
- **Requirements**: Define functional and non-functional requirements
- **Design**: Create architectural designs, threat models, and compliance documentation  
- **Implementation**: Develop code with proper testing and documentation

### 4. Deployment Traceability

Complete tracking of all production deployments with metadata for auditing and incident response.

#### Deployment Log
- **Location**: [`Deployments.md`](./Deployments.md)
- **Automation**: [`scripts/setup/update-deployments.js`](../../scripts/setup/update-deployments.js)
- **Format**: Structured table with all deployment metadata

#### Tracked Information
- **Temporal**: UTC and local timestamps
- **Source**: Actor, git SHA, PR/Issue numbers
- **Deployment**: Unique ID, production URL, health status
- **Recovery**: Rollback actions and incident response
- **Features**: Feature flag configurations
- **Process**: Links to process graph phase

## Traceability Workflows

### 1. Decision Tracking Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[Issue/RFC] --> B[ADR Draft]
B --> C[Stakeholder Review]
C --> D[ADR Accepted]
D --> E[Implementation]
E --> F[Validation]
F --> G[Deployment Log]
G --> H[Monitoring]
```

1. **Issue/RFC**: Problem or opportunity identified
2. **ADR Draft**: Create ADR using template with options analysis
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Review decision with relevant teams
4. **ADR Accepted**: Decision approved and status updated
5. **Implementation**: Code changes linked to ADR
6. **Validation**: Gate evidence validates implementation
7. **Deployment Log**: Changes tracked in deployment history
8. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment monitoring and feedback

### 2. Change Traceability Workflow

```mermaid

```

1. **Code Change**: All changes linked to issues or ADRs
2. **PR/Commit**: Conventional commit messages with traceability
3. **Gate Validation**: Required evidence and criteria checked
