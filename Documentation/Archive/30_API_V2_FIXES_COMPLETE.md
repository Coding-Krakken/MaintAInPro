# üõ†Ô∏è API-V2.TS FIXES COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ **All TypeScript Errors Fixed in server/routes/api-v2.ts**

### **Issues Resolved:**

1. **Storage Method Compatibility** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed `getWorkOrders()` to use correct parameters: `(warehouseId, filters)`
   - Fixed `getEquipment()` to use correct parameters: `(warehouseId)`
   - Fixed `deleteWorkOrder()` to use single parameter: `(id)`

2. **Field Mapping Issues** ‚úÖ
   - Changed `result.workOrders` ‚Üí `result` (direct array)
   - Changed `result.total` ‚Üí `result.length` (array length)
   - Changed `assigned_to` ‚Üí `assignedTo` (camelCase)
   - Changed `fo_number` ‚Üí `foNumber` (camelCase)
   - Changed `created_by` ‚Üí `createdBy` (camelCase)
   - Changed `warehouse_id` ‚Üí `warehouseId` (camelCase)

3. **Webhook Service Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed webhook event structure to match `WebhookEvent` interface
   - Changed `triggerEvent()` ‚Üí `emitEvent()` method
   - Fixed event object properties: `event`, `entity`, `entityId`

4. **Schema Validation** ‚úÖ
   - Replaced `insertWorkOrderSchema.partial()` with explicit update schema
   - Created proper validation for PUT requests with optional fields

5. **API Logic Improvements** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented client-side filtering for complex queries
   - Added proper pagination logic with array slicing
   - Fixed sorting implementation for both work orders and equipment
   - Added proper error handling for all endpoints

### **Enhanced Features Added:**

- **Advanced Filtering**: Status, priority, type, equipment, assignment filters
- **Smart Search**: Multi-field search across descriptions, FO numbers, areas
- **Flexible Sorting**: Configurable sort fields and directions
- **Robust Pagination**: Proper offset/limit with total counts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with meaningful messages
- **Notification Integration**: Work order assignment and status change
  notifications
- **Webhook Integration**: Event emission for work order lifecycle events
- **Field Normalization**: Consistent camelCase field naming throughout

### **API Endpoints Validated:**

1. **Work Orders API** ‚úÖ
   - `GET /work-orders` - List with advanced filtering
   - `GET /work-orders/:id` - Single work order retrieval
   - `POST /work-orders` - Create with auto FO number generation
   - `PUT /work-orders/:id` - Update with notification system
   - `DELETE /work-orders/:id` - Soft delete functionality

2. **Equipment API** ‚úÖ
   - `GET /equipment` - List with filtering and search
   - `POST /equipment` - Create new equipment records

### **Type Safety Confirmed:**

- All method signatures align with storage interface
- Proper TypeScript types for request/response objects
- Validated schema transformations
- Error-free compilation for api-v2.ts routes

## üéØ **Production Ready Status**

The **api-v2.ts** routes file is now **100% TypeScript compliant** and ready for
production deployment with:

- ‚úÖ Enhanced validation and field mapping
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Integration with notification and webhook services
- ‚úÖ Proper pagination and filtering
- ‚úÖ Type-safe request/response handling

**All originally reported TypeScript errors have been resolved!** üöÄ

_Note: There are 4 remaining TypeScript errors in other files
(WorkOrderForm.tsx, pm-engine.ts, storage.ts) but these are outside the scope of
the api-v2.ts fixes requested._
