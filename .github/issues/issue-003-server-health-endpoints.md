# Create Comprehensive Server API Health Check Endpoints

## 1. Issue Type
- [x] Feature Request
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] Enhancement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary
> Implement comprehensive health check endpoints for server monitoring and observability to support production readiness and automated deployment processes.

## 3. Context & Impact
- **Related files/modules:** `server/api/health/`, `server/routes/health.ts`
- **Environment:** Server-side, all deployment environments
- **Priority:** High
- **Blast Radius:** Monitoring systems, load balancers, deployment automation, operations team
- **Deadline/Target Release:** 2025-08-29

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan
### For Features/Enhancements:
1. Create health check route handlers for different service components
2. Implement database connectivity health checks
3. Add external service dependency health validation
4. Create structured health response format with detailed status information
5. Add metrics endpoint for Prometheus/monitoring integration

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence
> _Will provide health endpoint response examples and monitoring dashboard screenshots after implementation._

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/api/health` endpoint returns overall system health status
- [ ] `/api/health/detailed` endpoint provides component-level health information
- [ ] `/api/health/metrics` endpoint provides Prometheus-compatible metrics
- [ ] Database connection health checks implemented
- [ ] External service dependency checks (Redis, external APIs)
- [ ] Health checks respond within <100ms for readiness probes
- [ ] CI passes: `npm run health:test` validation

## Estimated Timeline
- **Estimated Start Date:** 2025-08-23
- **Estimated End Date:** 2025-08-29

## 9. Copilot Process-as-Code & Optimal Step Directives
> **For Copilot:**
>
> - Operate as if given the instructions from `Initialize.prompt.md` and `Next.prompt.md` directly.
> - Enforce process graph compliance, gate checks, atomic optimal steps, and traceability.
> - Self-calibrate by reading all required repo docs and sources of truth before acting.
> - Execute the single next most optimal, atomic step, keeping all gates passing and recording decisions as ADRs if non-trivial.
> - Output plan, diff summary, gate results, results, and next step at every iteration, autocontinuing unless paused.
> - Never bypass gates or improvise outside the process graph; always anchor actions in repo conventions and workflow.
