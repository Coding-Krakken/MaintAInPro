## 1. Issue Type
- [x] Feature Request
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] Enhancement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary
> Create an automated database backup system with scheduled backups, recovery procedures, and backup validation to ensure data protection and disaster recovery compliance.

## 3. Context & Impact
- **Related files/modules:** `scripts/backup/`, `config/backup.ts`, `api/backup/`
- **Environment:** Production, staging environments
- **Priority:** High
- **Blast Radius:** Data protection, compliance, disaster recovery
- **Deadline/Target Release:** 2025-08-30

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan
### For Features/Enhancements:
1. Create automated backup scripts for PostgreSQL database
2. Implement backup scheduling with configurable intervals
3. Add backup validation and integrity checking
4. Create recovery procedures and documentation
5. Set up backup monitoring and alerting

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence
> _Will provide backup dashboard screenshots and backup logs after implementation._

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated daily database backups scheduled
- [ ] Backup validation and integrity checks implemented
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Backup retention policy configurable
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for backup failures
- [ ] API endpoint for backup status at `/api/backup/status`
- [ ] CI passes: `npm run backup:validate` checks

## Estimated Timeline
- **Estimated Start Date:** 2025-08-25

## Copilot Process-as-Code
```yaml
automation:
  validation:
    - Test backup creation and restoration
    - Validate backup file integrity
    - Verify scheduling functionality
  implementation:
    - Create backup scripts in scripts/backup/
    - Implement backup configuration
    - Add monitoring endpoints
    - Document recovery procedures
  testing:
    - Unit tests for backup utilities
    - Integration tests for full backup flow
    - Recovery testing procedures
```

## Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL backup utilities (pg_dump)
- Configurable backup schedules (cron-based)
- Backup validation and checksum verification
- Secure backup storage configuration
- Recovery procedure automation

## Success Metrics
- Successful automated backups every 24 hours
- <5 minute backup validation time
- 99.9% backup success rate
- <30 minute recovery time for point-in-time restore

## Risk Mitigation
- Test backup procedures in staging environment
- Implement backup verification before production
- Document rollback procedures if backup system fails
- Monitor backup storage capacity and cleanup
