# Enhance Security Middleware with Rate Limiting and Input Sanitization

## 1. Issue Type

- [x] Enhancement
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] Feature Request
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary

> Enhance the existing security middleware with comprehensive rate limiting,
> input sanitization, and advanced security headers to protect against common
> web vulnerabilities.

## 3. Context & Impact

- **Related files/modules:** `server/middleware/security.middleware.ts`,
  `server/middleware/rate-limiting.ts`
- **Environment:** All environments, especially production
- **Priority:** High
- **Blast Radius:** Security posture, API protection, DoS prevention
- **Deadline/Target Release:** 2025-08-29

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan

### For Features/Enhancements:

1. Implement advanced rate limiting with different tiers for different endpoints
2. Add comprehensive input sanitization for XSS and injection attacks
3. Enhance security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
4. Create IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
5. Add security logging and monitoring integration

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence

> _Will provide security headers screenshots and rate limiting logs after
> implementation._

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Advanced rate limiting implemented with configurable limits per endpoint
- [ ] Input sanitization prevents XSS and SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Security headers properly configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] IP-based blocking for abuse detection
- [ ] Security event logging integrated with monitoring system
- [ ] Rate limiting bypass for authenticated admin users
- [ ] CI passes: `npm run security:validate` checks

## Estimated Timeline

- **Estimated Start Date:** 2025-08-23
- **Estimated End Date:** 2025-08-29

## Copilot Process-as-Code

```yaml
automation:
  validation:
    - Test rate limiting with various request patterns
    - Validate input sanitization against known attack vectors
    - Verify security headers are correctly applied
  implementation:
    - Enhance existing security middleware
    - Create rate limiting configuration
    - Add input sanitization utilities
    - Implement security logging
  testing:
    - Security penetration testing
    - Rate limiting stress tests
    - Input sanitization validation tests
```

## Technical Requirements

- Express rate limiting with Redis backend
- DOMPurify or similar for input sanitization
- Helmet.js for security headers
- IP geolocation for suspicious activity detection
- Integration with existing monitoring service

## Success Metrics

- Block >99% of automated attacks
- Rate limiting prevents DoS within 1 second
- Zero successful XSS/injection attempts in testing
- <10ms overhead per request for security middleware

## Risk Mitigation

- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- Whitelist known good IPs during testing
- Monitor false positive rates in rate limiting
- Have emergency security bypass procedures documented
