## Copilot Process-as-Code

```yaml
automation:
  validation:
    - Test WebSocket connection stability
    - Validate notification delivery across different scenarios
    - Verify push notification integration
  implementation:
    - Enhance WebSocket service architecture
    - Implement notification persistence
    - Create notification management components
    - Add push notification service
  testing:
    - Real-time notification delivery tests
    - WebSocket connection resilience tests
    - Notification preference management tests
```

## Technical Requirements

- WebSocket connection management with Socket.IO
- Notification persistence with PostgreSQL
- Push notification service integration (Firebase/OneSignal)
- React components for notification management
- User preference storage and API

## Success Metrics

- <500ms notification delivery time
- > 99.5% WebSocket connection uptime
- User notification preference adoption >60%
- Zero notification delivery failures in testing

## Risk Mitigation

- Implement connection fallback mechanisms
- Test notification delivery under high load
- Provide notification history backup
- Monitor WebSocket performance metrics
