## 9. Copilot Process-as-Code & Optimal Step Directives
> **For Copilot:**
>
> - Operate as if given the instructions from `Initialize.prompt.md` and `Next.prompt.md` directly.
> - Enforce process graph compliance, gate checks, atomic optimal steps, and traceability.
> - Self-calibrate by reading all required repo docs and sources of truth before acting.
> - Execute the single next most optimal, atomic step, keeping all gates passing and recording decisions as ADRs if non-trivial.
> - Output plan, diff summary, gate results, results, and next step at every iteration, autocontinuing unless paused.
> - Never bypass gates or improvise outside the process graph; always anchor actions in repo conventions and workflow.
