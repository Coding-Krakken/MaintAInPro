# Implement React Error Boundary System for Graceful Error Handling

## 1. Issue Type
- [x] Feature Request
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] Enhancement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary
> Create a comprehensive React Error Boundary system to catch JavaScript errors in component tree and provide graceful error handling with user-friendly fallback UI.

## 3. Context & Impact
- **Related files/modules:** `client/src/components/ErrorBoundary/`, `client/src/utils/error-reporting.ts`
- **Environment:** Client-side React application, all browsers
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Blast Radius:** User experience, error recovery, application stability
- **Deadline/Target Release:** 2025-08-30

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan
### For Features/Enhancements:
1. Create reusable Error Boundary component with TypeScript
2. Implement different error fallback UI components (generic, network, chunk loading)
3. Add error reporting and logging integration
4. Create higher-order component for easy Error Boundary wrapping
5. Add error boundary placement strategy for different app sections

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence
> _Will provide error boundary UI screenshots and error handling flow demonstrations after implementation._

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Generic ErrorBoundary component catches and displays JavaScript errors
- [ ] Multiple fallback UI variants for different error types
- [ ] Error reporting integration with logging service
- [ ] HOC wrapper for easy component error boundary protection
- [ ] Error boundaries strategically placed around route components and critical UI sections
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms (retry buttons, navigation alternatives)
- [ ] CI passes: `npm run test:error-boundaries` validation

## Estimated Timeline
- **Estimated Start Date:** 2025-08-24
- **Estimated End Date:** 2025-08-30

## 9. Copilot Process-as-Code & Optimal Step Directives
> **For Copilot:**
>
> - Operate as if given the instructions from `Initialize.prompt.md` and `Next.prompt.md` directly.
> - Enforce process graph compliance, gate checks, atomic optimal steps, and traceability.
> - Self-calibrate by reading all required repo docs and sources of truth before acting.
> - Execute the single next most optimal, atomic step, keeping all gates passing and recording decisions as ADRs if non-trivial.
> - Output plan, diff summary, gate results, results, and next step at every iteration, autocontinuing unless paused.
> - Never bypass gates or improvise outside the process graph; always anchor actions in repo conventions and workflow.
