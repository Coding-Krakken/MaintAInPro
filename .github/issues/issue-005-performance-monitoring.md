## 1. Issue Type
- [x] Feature Request
- [ ] Bug
- [ ] Enhancement
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Compliance
- [ ] Other: _Please specify_

## 2. Summary
> Implement comprehensive performance monitoring system with metrics collection, alerting, and dashboards to ensure application performance SLAs and enable proactive optimization.

## 3. Context & Impact
- **Related files/modules:** `monitoring/performance/`, `server/middleware/performance.ts`, `monitoring/config/`
- **Environment:** Full-stack monitoring across all environments
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Blast Radius:** Performance optimization, SLA monitoring, operational visibility
- **Deadline/Target Release:** 2025-08-31

## 4. Steps to Reproduce / Implementation Plan
### For Features/Enhancements:
1. Set up performance metrics collection middleware for Express.js
2. Implement client-side performance monitoring with Core Web Vitals
3. Create metrics aggregation and storage system
4. Set up performance alerting thresholds and notifications
5. Build performance monitoring dashboard with key metrics visualization

## 5. Screenshots / Evidence
> _Will provide performance dashboard screenshots and metrics examples after implementation._

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server-side performance metrics collection (response time, throughput, error rate)
- [ ] Client-side performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals, page load times)
- [ ] Performance metrics storage and aggregation system
- [ ] Automated performance alerting for SLA violations
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard accessible to operations team
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring config directory
- [ ] CI passes: `npm run performance:validate` checks

## Estimated Timeline
- **Estimated Start Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Estimated End Date:** 2025-08-31

## 9. Copilot Process-as-Code & Optimal Step Directives
> **For Copilot:**
>
> - Operate as if given the instructions from `Initialize.prompt.md` and `Next.prompt.md` directly.
> - Enforce process graph compliance, gate checks, atomic optimal steps, and traceability.
> - Self-calibrate by reading all required repo docs and sources of truth before acting.
> - Execute the single next most optimal, atomic step, keeping all gates passing and recording decisions as ADRs if non-trivial.
> - Output plan, diff summary, gate results, results, and next step at every iteration, autocontinuing unless paused.
> - Never bypass gates or improvise outside the process graph; always anchor actions in repo conventions and workflow.
