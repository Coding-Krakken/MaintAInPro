## 🏗️ Architectural Comparison

### Backend Architecture

#### Atlas CMMS

- **Pattern**: Traditional monolithic Spring Boot application
- **API**: REST endpoints with domain models
- **Database**: Direct PostgreSQL access
- **Storage**: MinIO/Google Cloud Storage
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for credentials

#### MaintAInPro

- **Pattern**: Serverless with Supabase backend-as-a-service
- **API**: Auto-generated REST/GraphQL from database schema
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with row-level security policies
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with bucket organization
- **Real-time**: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates

**Gap**: MaintAInPro lacks server-side business logic that ties database tables
together. While the API specification defines comprehensive schemas, there are
no implemented endpoints for core CMMS operations.

### Frontend Architecture

#### Atlas CMMS

- **Framework**: React/TypeScript with Material UI
- **Structure**: Traditional component hierarchy
- **Mobile**: Separate React Native application
- **Testing**: Limited documentation on testing strategy

#### MaintAInPro

- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Structure**: Domain-driven folder organization
- **Components**: Thoroughly tested, accessible component library
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E testing (247 tests, 100%
  success rate)
- **Quality**: Strict TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier enforcement

**Gap**: While MaintAInPro has superior UI foundation and testing, it lacks the
actual business module interfaces (work orders, equipment management, etc.) that
Atlas CMMS provides.
