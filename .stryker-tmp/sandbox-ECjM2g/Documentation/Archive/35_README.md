## Deployment

### Railway Deployment

The application is configured for easy deployment on Railway with the following
files:

- `railway.json`: Railway-specific configuration
- `nixpacks.toml`: Build and runtime configuration
- Health check endpoint: `/api/health`

#### Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in Railway:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- `PORT`: Port number (Railway sets this automatically)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (optional - uses in-memory
  storage as fallback)

#### Deployment Steps

1. Connect your repository to Railway
2. Set the required environment variables
3. Deploy - Railway will automatically:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the client application

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:

   ```bash
   export NODE_ENV=production
   export PORT=5000
   export DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
   ```

3. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
