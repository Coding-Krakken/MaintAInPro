# Implement Basic Escalation Condition Evaluation

## üìã Priority & Classification
**Priority**: P1 (High) - Business Logic Core  
**Type**: Feature Implementation  
**Phase**: 1.2 Core Business Enhancement  
**Epic**: Work Order Auto-Escalation  
**Assignee**: AI Agent  

## üéØ Executive Summary
Implement core logic for evaluating escalation conditions including age calculations and business hours handling.

**Business Impact**: Enables automatic detection of work orders requiring escalation based on configurable rules.

## üîç Problem Statement
No mechanism exists to evaluate when work orders should be escalated. Need core evaluation logic.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Age condition evaluation (time since creation)
- [ ] No-update condition evaluation (time since last update)
- [ ] Business hours calculation logic
- [ ] Weekend and holiday exclusion handling
- [ ] Condition evaluation utilities

## üîß Technical Requirements
```typescript
class ConditionEvaluator {
  evaluateAgeCondition(workOrder: WorkOrder, condition: EscalationCondition): boolean;
  evaluateNoUpdateCondition(workOrder: WorkOrder, condition: EscalationCondition): boolean;
  calculateBusinessMinutes(start: Date, end: Date, excludeWeekends: boolean): number;
  isBusinessTime(date: Date): boolean;
}
```

## üìä Success Metrics
- **Evaluation Accuracy**: 100% correct condition evaluation
- **Performance**: <10ms per condition evaluation
- **Business Hours**: Accurate weekend/holiday handling

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Condition evaluation unit tests
- Business hours calculation testing
- Edge case validation (holidays, weekends)

## üìà Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (1 day)  
**Lines Changed**: <200 lines  
**Complexity**: Medium
