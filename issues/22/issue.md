# Enhance unit test coverage for core services

## 📋 Overview
Achieve 95%+ test coverage for all services in `server/services/` with comprehensive mocking and performance benchmarking.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Achieve 95%+ unit test coverage for all core services
- Implement comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
- Add performance benchmarking tests
- Ensure all critical paths are tested

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage for all services in `server/services/`
- [ ] Comprehensive mocking for database and external APIs
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests for critical operations
- [ ] All edge cases and error conditions tested
- [ ] Test documentation and examples provided

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
Target services for enhanced coverage:
- `auth/security.service.ts`
- `performance.service.ts`
- `cache.service.ts`
- `file-management.service.ts`
- `background-jobs.ts`
- Custom business logic services

## 🧪 Testing Requirements
- Unit tests with proper isolation
- Mock external dependencies (database, APIs, file system)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations
- Test data factories for consistent test data

## ⚡ Performance Requirements
- Test execution under 30 seconds
- Individual test performance tracking
- Memory usage monitoring during tests

## 📊 Definition of Done
- [ ] Coverage report shows >95% for all target services
- [ ] All tests pass consistently
- [ ] Mocking strategy documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] CI/CD integration verified
