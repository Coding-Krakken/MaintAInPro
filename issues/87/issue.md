# High Priority Issue: Enhanced Validation Test Failure

## Problem

Unit test `should handle nested arrays correctly` in enhanced validation is
failing due to object key mismatch (camelCase vs snake_case).

## Impact

- Reduces reliability of validation utilities
- May affect data integrity in production

## Acceptance Criteria

- Fix the test or the implementation to ensure correct key transformation
- All enhanced validation tests must pass

## Priority

P1 (Critical)
