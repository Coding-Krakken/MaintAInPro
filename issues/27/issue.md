# Implement asset hierarchy and component tracking

## 📋 Overview
Create parent/child equipment relationship system with component-level maintenance tracking and hierarchical reporting.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create parent/child equipment relationship system
- Add component-level maintenance tracking
- Implement hierarchical reporting and analytics
- Enable equipment breakdown structure management

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria
