# Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization

## 📋 Overview

Enhance Zod schemas with security-focused validation and implement comprehensive
input sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enhance existing Zod schemas with security validations
- Implement SQL injection prevention auditing
- Add XSS protection and CSRF tokens
- Create comprehensive input sanitization framework

## 📝 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All input schemas enhanced with security validations
- [ ] SQL injection prevention mechanisms implemented
- [ ] XSS protection added to all user inputs
- [ ] CSRF token implementation for state-changing operations
- [ ] Input sanitization for file uploads and rich text
- [ ] Security audit tools integrated

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

- Enhance `shared/schema.ts` with security-focused validations
- Implement input sanitization middleware
- Add CSRF protection for forms
- Create XSS prevention utilities
- Implement file upload security scanning
- Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

- Security test suite for all validation scenarios
- Penetration testing simulation
- Input fuzzing tests
- XSS and injection attack simulation
- File upload security tests

## ⚡ Performance Requirements

- Validation processing under 50ms per request
- Minimal impact on existing API performance
- Efficient sanitization algorithms

## 📊 Definition of Done

- [ ] All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Security audit passes with zero critical issues
- [ ] CSRF protection functional
- [ ] XSS prevention verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
