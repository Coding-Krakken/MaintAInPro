## Context

MaintAInPro is an enterprise-grade Computerized Maintenance Management System
(CMMS) that requires a robust, scalable, and reliable database foundation. The
system must handle complex multi-tenant operations, support thousands of
concurrent users, manage extensive asset inventories, and provide real-time work
order management with strict data integrity requirements.

  concurrent users
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA with minimal downtime for maintenance
- **Data Integrity**: ACID compliance for critical business operations
- **Complex Relationships**: Work orders, equipment, parts, users, and
  organizational hierarchies
- **Advanced Features**: Full-text search, JSON data storage, audit trails,
  reporting
- **Performance**: P95 latency â‰¤ 500ms for all API endpoints

### Technical Requirements

- **Consistency**: Strong consistency for financial and compliance data
- **Transactions**: Support for complex multi-table operations
- **Querying**: Advanced SQL capabilities for reporting and analytics
- **Indexing**: Sophisticated indexing strategies for performance optimization
- **Extensions**: Support for specialized features (UUID, full-text search, JSON
  operations)
- **Backup & Recovery**: Enterprise-grade backup and point-in-time recovery
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive performance and health monitoring capabilities

### Regulatory Requirements

- **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Data privacy and user consent management
- **Audit Trails**: Complete change tracking for compliance purposes
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies with secure deletion
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control

## Decision

We have selected **PostgreSQL** as the primary database technology for
MaintAInPro CMMS based on its superior capabilities for enterprise applications
and alignment with our technical requirements.

### Key Decision Factors

#### 1. ACID Compliance & Data Integrity

PostgreSQL provides full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
compliance, ensuring:

- **Atomicity**: Complex work order operations complete fully or not at all
- **Consistency**: Database constraints maintain data validity across all
  operations
- **Isolation**: Concurrent user operations don't interfere with each other
- **Durability**: Committed transactions survive system failures

This is critical for maintenance management where data integrity directly
impacts operational safety and compliance.

#### 2. Advanced Feature Set

PostgreSQL offers advanced features essential for CMMS operations:

- **JSONB Support**: Flexible storage for equipment specifications, custom
  fields, and configurations
- **Full-Text Search**: Native search capabilities for work orders, manuals, and
  documentation
- **Array Types**: Efficient storage of tags, categories, and multi-value
  attributes
- **UUID Support**: Globally unique identifiers for multi-tenant data isolation
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Complex hierarchical queries for
  organizational structures

#### 3. Multi-Tenant Architecture Support

PostgreSQL excels at multi-tenant implementations through:

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-enforced tenant isolation
- **Schema Isolation**: Separate schemas per tenant when needed
- **Advanced Indexing**: Partial indexes for tenant-specific performance
  optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource utilization across multiple tenants

#### 4. Performance & Scalability

PostgreSQL provides enterprise-grade performance characteristics:

- **Advanced Query Optimization**: Cost-based query planner with extensive
  statistics
- **Parallel Processing**: Parallel query execution for large datasets
- **Partitioning**: Table and index partitioning for managing large data volumes
- **Streaming Replication**: Read replicas for scaling read operations
- **Connection Pooling**: PgBouncer integration for efficient connection
  management

#### 5. Ecosystem & Tooling

PostgreSQL offers a mature ecosystem aligned with our technology stack:

- **Drizzle ORM Integration**: Native PostgreSQL support with type-safe queries
- **Monitoring Tools**: Comprehensive solutions (pg_stat_statements, pgAdmin,
  monitoring extensions)
- **Migration Tools**: Robust schema migration and versioning support
- **Backup Solutions**: Enterprise-grade backup tools (pg_dump, pg_basebackup,
  WAL-E)
- **Cloud Support**: Native support in Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL

**Evaluation Summary**: Good general-purpose database but lacks advanced
features

**Pros**:

- Widespread adoption and community support
- Simpler administrative overhead
- Good performance for basic CRUD operations
- Mature replication and clustering solutions

**Cons**:

- Limited JSON support (JSON type less capable than PostgreSQL JSONB)
- Weaker consistency guarantees (especially with MyISAM storage engine)
- Fewer advanced SQL features (no CTEs until 8.0, limited window functions)
- Oracle ownership raises long-term licensing concerns for enterprise use

**Decision**: Rejected due to insufficient advanced feature support for complex
CMMS requirements and concerns about long-term roadmap under Oracle ownership.

### SQLite

**Evaluation Summary**: Excellent for development and embedded use, unsuitable
for production web applications

**Pros**:

- Zero configuration and administration overhead
- Excellent for development and testing environments
- File-based storage simplifies deployment
- High performance for single-user scenarios

**Cons**:

- No concurrent write support (single writer at a time)
- Not suitable for multi-user web applications
- No built-in user management or security features
- Limited scalability and networking capabilities
- No replication or high availability options

**Decision**: Rejected as unsuitable for production multi-user CMMS application
requirements.

### MongoDB

**Evaluation Summary**: Good for certain use cases but misaligned with CMMS
requirements

**Pros**:

- Flexible schema design
- Native JSON document storage
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Developer-friendly query syntax

**Cons**:

- Eventual consistency model inappropriate for financial/compliance data
- Complex queries require aggregation pipelines (less intuitive than SQL)
- Data integrity challenges without traditional ACID guarantees
- Memory-intensive for large datasets
- Limited support for complex relationships and joins
- Higher operational complexity for ensuring consistency

**Decision**: Rejected due to eventual consistency model being inappropriate for
enterprise maintenance management where data integrity is critical.

### Amazon DynamoDB / Other NoSQL

**Evaluation Summary**: Cloud-native NoSQL solutions better suited for different
use cases

**Pros**:

- Managed service with automatic scaling
- High availability and durability
- Pay-per-use pricing model

**Cons**:

- Vendor lock-in to specific cloud provider
- Limited query capabilities compared to SQL
- Complex pricing model for predictable workloads
- No support for complex relationships
- Eventual consistency challenges for critical business data
- Limited ecosystem and tooling compared to PostgreSQL

**Decision**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in concerns, limited querying
capabilities, and misalignment with relational data model requirements.
