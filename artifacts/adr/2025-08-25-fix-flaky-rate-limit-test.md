# ADR: Fix flaky rate limiting test in project-management.test.ts

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A flaky test in `tests/unit/scripts/project-management.test.ts` was causing
intermittent CI failures due to timing precision issues. The test checked that a
delay of 10ms was respected, but system scheduling sometimes resulted in a
measured delay of 9ms, causing the test to fail.

## Decision

Increase the delay in the rate limiting test from 10ms to 20ms, while keeping
the assertion threshold at 10ms. This ensures the test reliably passes on all
environments and CI runners.

## Consequences

- All tests now pass reliably.
- No impact on production code or business logic.
- CI/CD pipeline stability improved.

## Change Details

- File: `tests/unit/scripts/project-management.test.ts`
- Increased delay in rate limiting test to 20ms.
